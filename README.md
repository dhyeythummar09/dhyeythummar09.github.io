# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Hi! I'm Dhyey Thummar, and this is my personal portfolio website—built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It serves as a digital snapshot of who I am, what I’ve accomplished, and what I’m passionate about.

## 🎯 Purpose

This website was created as part of the course **CS6.201 – Introduction to Software Systems(Semester 2)**, but
more importantly, it serves as my personal portfolio to share with potential employers, collaborators, and
mentors. It reflects my foundation in web technologies and my attention to detail in design and interactivity.
